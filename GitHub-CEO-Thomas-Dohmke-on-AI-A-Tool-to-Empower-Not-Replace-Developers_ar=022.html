    <p>Thomas Dohmke, CEO of GitHub, has been vocal about the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in software development. In recent comments made in 2025, Dohmke emphasized that AI tools like GitHub Copilot are designed to boost developer productivity, not replace human coders. His insights, shared at events like VivaTech in Paris and the Africa Tech Festival, highlight a balanced view: AI can simplify coding but cannot fully substitute the technical expertise needed to scale complex systems. Here’s a look at Dohmke’s perspective on AI’s impact and why coding skills remain vital.</p>
    
    <p>At VivaTech in June 2025, Dohmke cautioned startup founders against over-relying on AI coding assistants, a trend dubbed “vibe coding” by OpenAI’s Andrej Karpathy. Vibe coding involves using natural language prompts to generate code, enabling non-technical founders to launch startups quickly with small teams. While this lowers barriers to entry, Dohmke warned that such startups often lack the robust systems needed to attract investors. He noted that investors might ask, “Why would I invest in you instead of the 10 other people?” if a company relies solely on AI-generated code. Scaling a business, he argued, requires skilled developers who can build complex, sustainable systems.</p>
    
    <p>Dohmke’s comments reflect a broader theme: AI is a collaborator, not a replacement. In an interview on “The MAD Podcast with Matt Turck,” he described the ideal workflow as one where developers use AI agents to write code and submit pull requests but retain the ability to make quick manual changes. He warned that spending minutes tweaking AI prompts for tasks that could be coded in seconds is a “productivity trap.” This flexibility—switching seamlessly between AI assistance and hands-on coding—is what Dohmke calls “the key for winning” in the AI era. His advice counters fears that AI will eliminate coding jobs, instead suggesting it will evolve the developer’s role.</p>
    
    <p>At the Africa Tech Festival in February 2024, Dohmke shared how GitHub Copilot, which now writes 25% of code in projects, has grown from a 2020 experiment with OpenAI’s GPT-3 to a tool that boosts efficiency. He recalled testing GPT-3 to write a JavaScript method for calculating prime numbers, marveling at its perfect syntax and logic. Today, Copilot integrates multiple AI models, giving developers choices for tasks like writing, testing, or debugging. Dohmke envisions a future where “AI-native” tools let anyone code, even on phones, using natural language. He believes this could lead to one billion developers worldwide, making coding as essential as math or reading.</p>
    
    <p>Dohmke also addressed job displacement concerns in a November 2024 interview with The Times of India. He stated that at Microsoft and GitHub, “we’re not worried about AI taking away half the engineering jobs.” Instead, he sees AI adding new skills, like prompt engineering, to developers’ toolkits. He stressed the need for continuous learning, noting that engineers must adapt to stay competitive. In a May 2025 YouTube interview with Azeem Azhar, Dohmke explained that AI helps developers stay in a “flow state,” automating repetitive tasks so they can focus on creative problem-solving. He compared AI’s role to the shift from low-level assembly languages to modern ones like Python, calling it the next step in coding’s evolution.</p>
    
    <p>Despite his optimism, Dohmke remains cautious about AI’s limits. In an October 2024 Business Today interview, he likened the pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) to fully autonomous vehicles—a goal still years away, requiring infrastructure and oversight. He emphasized that human developers will always guide AI, acting as “conductors of an AI-empowered orchestra.” This view aligns with his push for early coding education, arguing in April 2025 that schools should teach coding alongside subjects like physics to prepare kids for an AI-driven world.</p>
    
    <p>Dohmke’s comments show a clear vision: AI is reshaping coding by making it more accessible and efficient, but human expertise remains irreplaceable. Tools like Copilot, which drives 40% of GitHub’s revenue growth, empower developers to innovate faster, from startups to enterprises. Yet, as Dohmke warns, over-dependence on AI without technical skills can limit growth, especially for startups seeking to scale. His message to developers is to embrace AI while honing their coding craft to stay ahead. Credit: Thomas Dohmke.</p>
